    "### Review of Linear Programming\n",
    "A linear programming is an optimization of a linear objective function over a convex set. The convex set is called polyhedron that is the intersection of finite number of half-spaces. If the conex set is feasible, then it has at least one extreme point and further if the optimization problem has a finite optimal solution , it must be attained at one of the extrement points as shown below.\n",
    "#### Problem formulation in standard form\n",
    "Every linear programming can be written in the following standard form:<br><br>\n",
    "Minimize: $\\quad CX $ <br>\n",
    "subject to:$\\quad AX=b $<br>\n",
    " $\\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad$ $X\\ge 0$. <br><br>\n",
    "Vector $C$ is the cost coefficients. Matrix $A$ is the coefficients of linear contraints and $b$ is right-hand terms. The set $P=\\{x\\in \\Re^n:Ax=b,x\\ge 0\\}$ is convex and define a polyhedron.\n",
    "#### Fundamental theorem of linear programming\n",
    "Let $P=\\{x:Ax=b,x\\ge 0\\}$. If $A$ is of full rank and $\\underset{x\\in P}{max} \\{cx\\}$ has a finite optimal solution, there is an optimal solution at one of the extreme points of $P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "There are $m$ flight resources with capacity $c_i>0$ for each resource $i$. Combining flight origin, destination and fare class, we have $n$ ODF. We assume $m<n$ so each resource used in at least 1 ODF. The incidence matrix $A$ has elements $a_{i,j}$ as follows.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a_{i,j} = \\left\\{\n",
    "        \\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "            1 & \\quad \\text{if resource $i$ used in product $j$}\\\\\n",
    "            0 & \\quad \\text{Otherwise.}\n",
    "        \\end{array}\n",
    "    \\right.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The decisions $x_j$ to make are how many seats to sell for each ODF $j$. Suppose there are 2 resources: flight from San Francisco to Denver and Denver to St. louis and 2 fare classes: full and discount. Then we have total 6 ODF. The revenue terms are $p_j$ for each unit sale of product $j$. We assume demand are known as $d_j$ for each ODF. The revenue maximization can be formulated as follows.<br><br>\n",
    "Maximize: $\\overset{6}{\\underset{j=1}{\\Sigma}}P_jX_j $ <br>\n",
    "subject to :$\\overset{6}{\\underset{j=1}{\\Sigma}} a_{i,j}X_j \\le c_i \\quad \\forall i$<br>\n",
    " $\\quad \\quad \\quad $ $X_j\\le d_j \\quad \\forall j$<br>\n",
    " $\\quad \\quad \\quad $ $X_j\\ge 0 \\quad \\forall j$.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discussion \n",
    "1. known deterministic demand $d_j$ : Deterministic LP ignores the uncertainty in real demand.\n",
    "2. The LP doesn't model the dynamics of the demand. Its solution provides a partition-based booking policy that ignores the inter-relations among flight resources. In practice, the performance is not optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Duality\n",
    "Consider the standard form LP as follows and call it the primal problem.<br><br>\n",
    "$\\textbf{Primal}$<br>\n",
    "Minimize: $\\quad CX $ <br>\n",
    "subject to:$\\quad AX=b $<br>\n",
    " $\\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad$ $X\\ge 0$. <br><br>\n",
    " Assume an optimal solution exists and call it $x^*$. We introduce a relaxed problem to the primal by replacing the constraint with a penalty term in the objective function as follows.<br> <br>\n",
    " $\\textbf{Primal relaxation}$<br>\n",
    " Minimize: $\\quad CX+p(b-Ax) $ <br>\n",
    "subject to: $\\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad$ $X\\ge 0$. <br><br>\n",
    "let $g(p)$ be the optimal value to the primal relaxation that is a function of price vector $p$. As can be seen below, the primal relaxation allows more options and its optimal value is no larger than that in the primal problem.\n",
    "$$g(p)=\\underset{x\\ge 0}{min}[cx+p(b-Ax)]\\le cx^*+p(b-Ax^*)=cx^*$$\n",
    "#### Formulation of dual to primal problem\n",
    " \n",
    "Maximize: $\\quad Pb$ <br>\n",
    "subject to: $\\quad PA \\le C$. <br><br>\n",
    "The vector $p$ is a price vector that corresponds to each linear constraints in the primal problem. Notice that non-negative constraints in primal problem correspond to the signs of the constraints in dual problem. <br><br>\n",
    "In summary, we have the following formulation between priml and dual problems.<br>\n",
    "\\begin{array} {|r|r|} \\hline \n",
    "Primal & Minimize & Maximize & Dual \\\\ \\hline\n",
    "Constrints &\\ge b_i & \\ge 0 &Variables \\\\\n",

    " &\\le 0 &\\ge c_j & \\\\ \n",
    "  &free &= c_j & \\\\ \\hline\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "Continue the same airline example above. It is popular in practice to book flights by bid prices. That is, a demand is accepted given the demand of class $j$ is no lower than sum of the bid price of required resources of class $j$. We formulate the dual to the primal problem above and calculate the bid prices.<br><br>\n",
    "Minimize: $\\overset{2}{\\underset{i=1}{\\Sigma}}p_i c_i +\\overset{6}{\\underset{j=1}{\\Sigma}}q_jd_j $ <br>\n",

    " $\\quad \\quad \\quad $ $p_i\\ge 0 \\quad \\forall i$.<br>\n",
    " In the dual problem, $p_i$ are dual prices corresponding to resource capacity contraints that are used in bid price policy. Dual variables $q_j$ are related to demand contraints in the primal.<bf><br>\n",
    " \n",
    "We continue to review some important resutls in duality theory.<br>\n",
    "$\\mathbf{Lemma:}$ (1) If primal program is infeasible then its dual is either infeasible or unbounded. (2)If if the dual is unbounded then the primal is infeasible.<br><br>\n",
    "Notice that there are just 3 cases in a linear programming problem: 1) Infeasible,2) finite optimal; and 3)unbounded.<br><br>\n",
    "$\\textbf{Weak duality theorem:}$ If primal problem is finite optimal, so is the dual and furhter $P^*b\\le cx^*$,where $x^*$ and $p^*$ are primal and dual optimal solutions respectively.<br><br>\n",
    "$\\textbf{Strong duality theorem:}$ If feasible solutions for primal problem exist, then they are equal,i.e.,$P^*b=cx^*$.<br><br>\n",
    "Notice that weak duality states that dual optimum is a lower bound on primal optimum. Strong duality further says the bound is tight.\n",
    "### Review of Dynamic Progeamming\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, dynamic programming addresses how to make optimal decisions over time. In nature, it can be both stochastic and deterministic. In this revie,we focus on stochastic program and summarize the key results. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are $T$ periods. Time is indexed by $t$. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. System state: $x(t)$ assumed to be discrete and constrained in a finite set $S_t$.<br>\n",
    "2. Control system: $u(t)$ assumed to be discrete and constrined in a finite set $U_t(x(t))$.<br>\n",
    "3. Random disturbance: $w(t))$ assumed to be discrete random variable/vector with known distribution. They are independent over time.<br>\n",
    "4. System function: $f_t(x(t),u(t),w(t))$ determines the next state as a function of current state, decisions and disturbance by $x(t+1)=f_t(x(t),u(t),w(t))$.<br>\n",
    "5. Reward function: $g_t(x(t),u(t),w(t))$ assumed to be real-valued function of current state, decisions and disturbance. The total reward is additive as follows. $$g_{T+1}(x(T+1)+\\overset{T}{\\underset{t=1}{\\Sigma}}g_t(x(t),u(t),w(t)).$$ <br><br>\n",
    "6. Control policy: ${u_1,u_2,...,u_T}$ is a collectin of actions. It is admissive if $u(t)\\in \\mathbb U(x(t)).$<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the dynamic programm is to maximize the total expected reward below by choosing control actions $u(t)$ over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb E[g_{T+1}(x(T+1)+\\overset{T}{\\underset{t=1}{\\Sigma}}g_t(x(t),u(t),w(t))].$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected reward of a control policy $\\mu$ is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_1^{\\mu}(x)=\\mathbb E[g_{T+1}(x(T+1)+\\overset{T}{\\underset{t=1}{\\Sigma}}g_t(x(t),\\mu(t),w(t))].$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An optimal policy $\\mu^*$ is one for which $V_1^{\\mu^*}=\\underset{\\mu\\in \\mathbb M}{Sup} \\quad V_1^{\\mu}(x).$ The optimal expected reward is denoted by $V_1(x).$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The principle of optimality\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of optimality lies at the heart of dynamic programming. It basically says that if a policy is optimal for the original problem above then it must be optimal fo any subproblem of this same original problem. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the reward-to-go for policy $\\mu$ at time $t$ by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_t^{\\mu}(x)=\\mathbb E[g_{T+1}(x(T+1)+\\overset{T}{\\underset{s=t}{\\Sigma}}g_s(x(s),\\mu(s),w(s))| x(t)=x].$$<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{Therem}$: If policy $\\mu^*=\\{\\mu_1^*,\\mu_2^*,...,\\mu_T^*\\}$ is an optimal policy for the dynamic program define above, then truncated policy $\\{\\mu_t^*,\\mu_{t+1}^*,...,\\mu_T^*\\}$ is optimal for the t-subproblem. That is,<br><br>\n",
    "$$V_t^{\\mu^*}(x)=\\underset{\\mu\\in \\mathbb M}{Sup} \\quad V_t^{\\mu}(x)\\quad \\forall x\\in S_t.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The dynamic programming recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of optimality leads to a recursion procedure for finding optimal plicy. We define optimal reward-to-go as follows, which is also called value function.\n",
    "$$V_t(x)=\\underset{\\mu\\in \\mathbb M}{Sup} \\quad V_t^{\\mu}$$ <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{Proposition}$: The value function $V_t(x)$ is the unique solution to the recursion below<br><br>\n",
    "$$V_t(x)=\\mathbb E[g_{T+1}(x(T+1)+\\overset{T}{\\underset{s=t}{\\Sigma}}g_s(x(s),\\mu(s),w(s))| x(t)=x],$$ for all $t$ and all $x\\in S_t$ with boundary condition $V_{T+1}(x)=g_{T+1}(x), \\forall x\\in S_{T+1}.$\n",
    "Moreover, if $\\mu^*=\\mu_t^*(x)$ achieves the maximum in above, then $\\mu=\\{\\mu_1^*,\\mu_2^*,...,\\mu_T^*\\}$ is an optimal policy.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Systems with observable disturbances\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the case in which we determine actions based upon perfect knowledge of the disturbance $w(t)$ in each time $t$. In other words, we allow the decision to be a function of both system state $x(t)$ and random disturbance $w(t)$. The idea is that in this situation we can observe the disturbance before making our decision.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    " \n",
    " In this case, the basic dynamic programming recursion becomes\n",
    " $$V_t(x)=\\underset{\\mu(x,w(t))\\in \\mathbf U_t(x)}{max} \\quad E[g_t(x,\\mu(t,w(t)),w(t))+V_{t+1}(f_t(x,\\mu(x,u(x,w(t)),w(t)))].$$<br><br>\n",
    " Since we can choose a control decision  based upon knowing $w(t)$, the recursion can be rewritten as \n",
    "$$V_t(x)=E[\\underset{\\mu\\in \\mathbf U_t(x)}{max} \\quad g_t(x,\\mu,w(t))+V_{t+1}(f_t(x,\\mu,w(t))].$$<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursion above has switched $E[max\\{\\}]$ with $max \\{E[]\\}$ because optimal decision $\\mu_t(x)$ in time $t$ can be chosen based upon each realized random term $w(t)$. By using this transformation we have reduced the state space from $S_t\\times W_t$ in original DP problem to $S_t$ in the reduced-form DP.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application of dynamic program in revenue management\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a typical example of how this transformation applies in RM. Suppose $x(t)$ is a scalar capacity, $y(t)$ is the revenue of the request in period $t$, and $\\mu(t)=1$ if we decide to accept a request and $0$ otherwise. The reward function is simply $y(t)u(t)$. Capacity as a system state evolves according to $x(t+1)=x(t)-u(t),$ and revenue is derived by a random process $y(t+1)=w(t+1)$. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A dynamic program can be formulated traditionally as \n",
    "$$V_t(x,y)=\\underset{\\mu\\in \\{0,1\\}}{max} E\\big[yu+V_{t+1}(x-u,w(t))\\big]$$.<br>\n",
    "However, with transformation above, the recursino can be reduced in observable-disturbance form as <br><br>\n",
    "$$G_t(x)=E\\big [\\underset{\\mu\\in \\{0,1\\}}{max} \\{w(t)u+G_{t+1}(x-u)\\}\\big].$$<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $G_t(x)$ has similar interpretation as $V_t(x,y)$, namely, the optimal expected reward-to-go from time $t$ onward given state $x(t)$ at time $t$. Conceptually, we can consider recursion $G_t$ in a 2-stage manner as follows. First, state $x$ is realized but $y$ remains uncertain. We measure the optimal expected reward at this point, yielding $G_t(x)$. Then the value $y=w(t)$ is realized, and we make our optimal decision. This takes us to next state $x(t+1)$. \n",

    "## Forecasting in revenue management\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is forecasting important in revenue management?\n",
    "\n",
    "A revenue management system requires forecasts of quantities such as demand, price elasticity and cancellation probabilities. It is reported that 20% error reduction in forecasting leads to 1% revenue improvement. With new technology of collecting customer data in almost real time and advance of forecasting software packages, accurate forecasting adds significant values in revenue management. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The forecasting module is a component of a revenue management system. It generates and updates forecasts for all product/fare combinations for all future dates. Generally, an initial forecast will be generated about one year prior to departure when the booking opens in most RM systems. Then the forecasts will be updated periodically as bookings and cnacellations are received over time. Typically, a forecast will be updated monthly when a flight is six months or more from departure and more frequently as departure approaches. Forecasts are typically updated daily for flights are within two weeks of departure. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The forecast generated by RM systems are probablistic and they predict both a mean and standard deviation for future demand. As can be seen later, uncertainty plays a big role in updating booking limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forecasting process\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasting is a vast topic spanning a diverse range of fields including statistics,computer science, engineering and economics. Over many years, a core set of  forecasting methods have been developed and new improvements continue. Some of the forecasting methods are rigorous and others are largely heuristic in nature. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Demand forecsting is more of an iterative process than techniques. As shown below, it starts with collecting and storing data. Actual modeling by statistical techniques is just an intermediate step in the overall process. More importantly, it is to monitor and manage the forecasting performance and update previous forecasts.<br><br>\n",

    "### Forecasting methods\n",
    "As can be seen above, the forecasting process starts with collecting and pre-processing relevant data and information. Now, we turn to forecasting methods, which explicitly use data to predict values of a sequence of data. In revenue management, we are mostly interested in forecasting demand,though sometimes we also need to estimate cancellation and no-show rates. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"C:/myPython/Fcst_Cost_Benefit.PNG\" width=\"450\" height=\"400\">\n",

    "In RM, the emphasis of forecasting methods is on speed, simplicity and robustness. We must balance accuracy with cost. The forecaster need to understand how accurate do I need to be for this product. Are incremental increases\n",
    "in forecast accuracy worth the additional investment? It is also because of the balance and cost-benefit of forecasting that most forecasting algorithms in RM practice are variations of standard methods and most are not mathematically sophosticated. We first review standard forecasting methods and then further demonstrate enhanced forecasting techniques.<br><br>\n",

    "The challenge is to obtain the posterior distribution from a given prior. In certain cases,iIt turns out the posterior has same type of distribution as the prior.

    " <font color=blue> Revenue management (RM) is concerned with such demand-management decisions1 and the methodology and systems required to make them. It involves managing the firm’s “interface with the market,” as it were—with the objective of increasing revenues. RM can be thought of as the complement of supply chain management (SCM), which addresses the supply decisions and processes of a firm with the objective (typically) of lowering the cost of production and delivery.</font> \n",
    " \n",
    "### Demand-Management Decisions\n",
    " \n",
    " RM addresses three basic categories of demand-management decisions:<br><br>\n",
    "1. Structural decisions: Which selling format to use (such as posted prices, negotiations, or auctions); which segmentation or differentiation mechanisms to use (if any); which terms of trade to offer (including volume discounts and cancellation or refund options); how to bundle products; and so on.<br>\n",
    "2. Price decisions: How to set posted prices, individual-offer prices, and reserve prices (in auctions); how to price across product categories; how to price over time; how to mark down(discount) over the product lifetime; and so on.<br>\n",
    "3. Quantity decisions: Whether to accept or reject an offer to buy; how to allocate output or capacity to different segments, products, or channels; when to withhold a product from the market and sale at later points in time; and so on.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    " Structural decisions about which mechanism to use for selling and how to segment and bundle products are normally strategic decisions taken relatively infrequently. Whether a firm uses quantity-based or price-based RM controls varies even across firms within a given industry.<br>\n",
    " \n",
    "### What’s New About RM?\n",
    "In one sense, RM is a very old idea. The theory of RM, at a broad level, is not new either.What is new about RM is not the demand-management decisions themselves, but rather how these decisions are made. The new approach is driven by scientific advances in economics, statistics, and operations research and at the same time the advances in information technology. <br>\n",
    "The process of managing demand decisions with science and technology—implemented\n",
    "with disciplined processes and systems, and overseen by human analysts (a sort of “industrialization”\n",
    "of the entire demand-management process)—defines modern RM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Origins of RM?\n",
    "Where did RM come from? In short, the airline industry.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point for RM was the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. With this act,the U.S. Civil Aviation Board (CAB) loosened control of airline prices, which had been strictly regulated based on standardized price and profitability targets.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The potential of this market was embodied in the rapid rise of upstars such as PeopleExpress. A significant portion of price-sensitive discretionary travelers migrated to the new, low-cost carriers. For the majors, the price war with the upstarts was deemed almost suicidal. American solved these problems using a combination of purchase restrictions and capacity controll fares. American further embarked on the development of what became known as the Dynamic Inventory Allocation and Maintenance Optimizer system (DINAMO). These efforts on DINAMO represent,in many ways, the first large-scale RM system development in the industry. DINAMO was implemented in full in January 1985 along with a new fare program entitled Ultimate Super-Saver Fares, which matched or undercut the lowest discount fares available in every market American served.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A large, modern airline today would just not be able to operate profitably without RM. By most estimates, the revenue gains from the use of RM systems are roughly comparable to many airlines’ total profitability in a good year (about 4% to 5% of revenues).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Industry Adopters Beyond the Airlines\n",
    "The production-inflexibility characteristics of airlines are shared by many other service industries, such as hotels, cruise ship lines, car rental companies, theaters and sporting venues, and radio/TV broadcasters,to name a few. Indeed, RM is strongly associated with service industries.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Retailers have recently begun to adopt RM, especially in the fashion apparel, consumer electronics, and toy sectors. Retail demand is highly volatile and uncertain, consumers’ valuations change rapidly over time, and with short selling seasons and long production and distribution lead times, supply is quite inflexible. On the technology front, the introduction of bar codes and point-of-sale (POS) technology has resulted in a high degree of automation of sales transactions for most major retailers.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy sector has been a recent adopter of RM methods as well, principally in the area of managing the sale of pipeline capacity for gas transportation. Again, energy demands are volatile and uncertain, and the technology for generating and transmitting electricity and gas can be inflexible. Also, thanks to deregulation in the industry, there has been a lot of experimentation and innovation in the pricing practices of energy, gas, and transmission\n",
    "markets.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Conceptual Framework for RM\n",
    "RM generally follows four steps:<br><br>\n",
    "1. Data collection: collect and store relevant historical data such as prices, demand and causal factors.<br>\n",
    "2. Estimation and forecasting: estimate the demand, price elasticity, cancellation rate, and so on.<br>\n",
    "3. Optimization: find optimal control policies such as product allocations, prices, discounts and so on.<br>\n",
    "4. Control: control inventory.<br><br>\n",
    "In reality, the RM process involves cycling through the steps above in repeated intervals.<br><br>\n",

More often, the primal allocations are discarded due to poor revenue performance.

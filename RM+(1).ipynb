    "Fundamentally, dynamic programming addresses how to make optimal decisions over time. In nature, it can be both stochastic and deterministic. In this revie,we focus on stochastic program and summarize the key results. <br><br>\n",

    "There are $T$ periods. Time is indexed by $t$. <br>\n",

    "1. System state: $x(t)$ assumed to be discrete and constrained in a finite set $S_t$.<br>\n",
    "2. Control system: $u(t)$ assumed to be discrete and constrined in a finite set $U_t(x(t))$.<br>\n",

    "6. Control policy: ${u_1,u_2,...,u_T}$ is a collectin of actions. It is admissive if $u(t)\\in \\mathbb U(x(t)).$<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the dynamic programm is to maximize the total expected reward below by choosing control actions $u(t)$ over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb E[g_{T+1}(x(T+1)+\\overset{T}{\\underset{t=1}{\\Sigma}}g_t(x(t),u(t),w(t))].$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected reward of a control policy $\\mu$ is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_1^{\\mu}(x)=\\mathbb E[g_{T+1}(x(T+1)+\\overset{T}{\\underset{t=1}{\\Sigma}}g_t(x(t),\\mu(t),w(t))].$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An optimal policy $\\mu^*$ is one for which $V_1^{\\mu^*}=\\underset{\\mu\\in \\mathbb M}{Sup} \\quad V_1^{\\mu}(x).$ The optimal expected reward is denoted by $V_1(x).$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The principle of optimality\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of optimality lies at the heart of dynamic programming. It basically says that if a policy is optimal for the original problem above then it must be optimal fo any subproblem of this same original problem. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the reward-to-go for policy $\\mu$ at time $t$ by \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{Therem}$: If policy $\\mu^*=\\{\\mu_1^*,\\mu_2^*,...,\\mu_T^*\\}$ is an optimal policy for the dynamic program define above, then truncated policy $\\{\\mu_t^*,\\mu_{t+1}^*,...,\\mu_T^*\\}$ is optimal for the t-subproblem. That is,<br><br>\n",
    "$$V_t^{\\mu^*}(x)=\\underset{\\mu\\in \\mathbb M}{Sup} \\quad V_t^{\\mu}(x)\\quad \\forall x\\in S_t.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The dynamic programming recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of optimality leads to a recursion procedure for finding optimal plicy. We define optimal reward-to-go as follows, which is also called value function.\n",
    "$$V_t(x)=\\underset{\\mu\\in \\mathbb M}{Sup} \\quad V_t^{\\mu}$$ <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{Proposition}$: The value function $V_t(x)$ is the unique solution to the recursion below<br><br>\n",
    "$$V_t(x)=\\mathbb E[g_{T+1}(x(T+1)+\\overset{T}{\\underset{s=t}{\\Sigma}}g_s(x(s),\\mu(s),w(s))| x(t)=x],$$ for all $t$ and all $x\\in S_t$ with boundary condition $V_{T+1}(x)=g_{T+1}(x), \\forall x\\in S_{T+1}.$\n",
    "Moreover, if $\\mu^*=\\mu_t^*(x)$ achieves the maximum in above, then $\\mu=\\{\\mu_1^*,\\mu_2^*,...,\\mu_T^*\\}$ is an optimal policy.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Systems with observable disturbances\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the case in which we determine actions based upon perfect knowledge of the disturbance $w(t)$ in each time $t$. In other words, we allow the decision to be a function of both system state $x(t)$ and random disturbance $w(t)$. The idea is that in this situation we can observe the disturbance before making our decision.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    " \n",
    " In this case, the basic dynamic programming recursion becomes\n",
    " $$V_t(x)=\\underset{\\mu(x,w(t))\\in \\mathbf U_t(x)}{max} \\quad E[g_t(x,\\mu(t,w(t)),w(t))+V_{t+1}(f_t(x,\\mu(x,u(x,w(t)),w(t)))].$$<br><br>\n",
    " Since we can choose a control decision  based upon knowing $w(t)$, the recursion can be rewritten as \n",
    "$$V_t(x)=E[\\underset{\\mu\\in \\mathbf U_t(x)}{max} \\quad g_t(x,\\mu,w(t))+V_{t+1}(f_t(x,\\mu,w(t))].$$<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursion above has switched $E[max\\{\\}]$ with $max \\{E[]\\}$ because optimal decision $\\mu_t(x)$ in time $t$ can be chosen based upon each realized random term $w(t)$. By using this transformation we have reduced the state space from $S_t\\times W_t$ in original DP problem to $S_t$ in the reduced-form DP.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application of dynamic program in revenue management\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a typical example of how this transformation applies in RM. Suppose $x(t)$ is a scalar capacity, $y(t)$ is the revenue of the request in period $t$, and $\\mu(t)=1$ if we decide to accept a request and $0$ otherwise. The reward function is simply $y(t)u(t)$. Capacity as a system state evolves according to $x(t+1)=x(t)-u(t),$ and revenue is derived by a random process $y(t+1)=w(t+1)$. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A dynamic program can be formulated traditionally as \n",
    "$$V_t(x,y)=\\underset{\\mu\\in \\{0,1\\}}{max} E\\big[yu+V_{t+1}(x-u,w(t))\\big]$$.<br>\n",
    "However, with transformation above, the recursino can be reduced in observable-disturbance form as <br><br>\n",
    "$$G_t(x)=E\\big [\\underset{\\mu\\in \\{0,1\\}}{max} \\{w(t)u+G_{t+1}(x-u)\\}\\big].$$<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $G_t(x)$ has similar interpretation as $V_t(x,y)$, namely, the optimal expected reward-to-go from time $t$ onward given state $x(t)$ at time $t$. Conceptually, we can consider recursion $G_t$ in a 2-stage manner as follows. First, state $x$ is realized but $y$ remains uncertain. We measure the optimal expected reward at this point, yielding $G_t(x)$. Then the value $y=w(t)$ is realized, and we make our optimal decision. This takes us to next state $x(t+1)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{Exercise}$: A single-leg revenume managment problem.<br>\n",
    "1. Assuming there are 10 classes. \n",
    "2. Demand $D_j$ is calculated through discretizing a truncated normal with mean 0 and standard deviation 2, on support $[0,20]$. Speciccally, take:\n",
    "$$P(D_j = k) =\\frac{\\Phi((k + 0.5- 10)/2)-\\Phi((k -0.5-10)/2)}{\\Phi((20.5-10)/2)-\\Phi((-0.5-10)/2)}, \\quad k = 0,...,20$$\n",

    "## Chapter 1: Introduction to Revenue Management\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is revenue management?\n",
    "\n",
    "Every seller of a product or service faces a number of fundamental decisions. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A child selling lemonade outside her house has to decide on which day to have her sale, how much to ask\n",
    "for each cup, and when to drop the price (if at all) as the day rolls on.<br>\n",
    "2. A homeowner selling a house must decide when to list it, what the asking price should be, which offer to accept, and when to lower the listing price—and by how much—if no offers come in. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Businesses face even more complex selling decisions. <br>\n",
    "1. how can a firm segment buyers by providing different conditions and terms of trade that profitably exploit their\n",
    "different buying behavior or willingness to pay?<br>\n",
    "2. How can a firm design products to prevent cannibalization across segments and channels?<br>\n",
    "3. Once it segments customers, what prices should it charge each segment?If the firm sells in different channels, should it use the same price in each channel?<br>\n",
    "4. How should prices be adjusted over time, based on seasonal factors and the observed demand to date for each product?<br>\n",
    "5. If a product is in short supply, to which segments and channels should it allocate the products?<br>\n",
    "6. How should a firm manage the pricing and allocation decisions for products that are complements(seats on two connecting airline flights) or substitutes (different car categories for rentals)?<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " <font color=blue> Revenue management (RM) is concerned with such demand-management decisions1 and the methodology and systems required to make them. It involves managing the firm’s “interface with the market,” as it were—with the objective of increasing revenues. RM can be thought of as the complement of supply chain management (SCM), which addresses the supply decisions and processes of a firm with the objective (typically) of lowering the cost of production and delivery.</font> \n",
    " \n",
    "### Demand-Management Decisions\n",
    " \n",
    " RM addresses three basic categories of demand-management decisions:<br><br>\n",
    "1. Structural decisions: Which selling format to use (such as posted prices, negotiations, or auctions); which segmentation or differentiation mechanisms to use (if any); which terms of trade to offer (including volume discounts and cancellation or refund options); how to bundle products; and so on.<br>\n",
    "2. Price decisions: How to set posted prices, individual-offer prices, and reserve prices (in auctions); how to price across product categories; how to price over time; how to mark down(discount) over the product lifetime; and so on.<br>\n",
    "3. Quantity decisions: Whether to accept or reject an offer to buy; how to allocate output or capacity to different segments, products, or channels; when to withhold a product from the market and sale at later points in time; and so on.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    " Structural decisions about which mechanism to use for selling and how to segment and bundle products are normally strategic decisions taken relatively infrequently. Whether a firm uses quantity-based or price-based RM controls varies even across firms within a given industry.<br>\n",
    " \n",
    "### What’s New About RM?\n",
    "In one sense, RM is a very old idea. The theory of RM, at a broad level, is not new either.What is new about RM is not the demand-management decisions themselves, but rather how these decisions are made. The new approach is driven by scientific advances in economics, statistics, and operations research and at the same time the advances in information technology. <br>\n",
    "The process of managing demand decisions with science and technology—implemented\n",
    "with disciplined processes and systems, and overseen by human analysts (a sort of “industrialization”\n",
    "of the entire demand-management process)—defines modern RM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Origins of RM?\n",
    "Where did RM come from? In short, the airline industry.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point for RM was the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. With this act,the U.S. Civil Aviation Board (CAB) loosened control of airline prices, which had been strictly regulated based on standardized price and profitability targets.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The potential of this market was embodied in the rapid rise of upstars such as PeopleExpress. A significant portion of price-sensitive discretionary travelers migrated to the new, low-cost carriers. For the majors, the price war with the upstarts was deemed almost suicidal. American solved these problems using a combination of purchase restrictions and capacity controll fares. American further embarked on the development of what became known as the Dynamic Inventory Allocation and Maintenance Optimizer system (DINAMO). These efforts on DINAMO represent,in many ways, the first large-scale RM system development in the industry. DINAMO was implemented in full in January 1985 along with a new fare program entitled Ultimate Super-Saver Fares, which matched or undercut the lowest discount fares available in every market American served.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A large, modern airline today would just not be able to operate profitably without RM. By most estimates, the revenue gains from the use of RM systems are roughly comparable to many airlines’ total profitability in a good year (about 4% to 5% of revenues).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Industry Adopters Beyond the Airlines\n",
    "The production-inflexibility characteristics of airlines are shared by many other service industries, such as hotels, cruise ship lines, car rental companies, theaters and sporting venues, and radio/TV broadcasters,to name a few. Indeed, RM is strongly associated with service industries.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Retailers have recently begun to adopt RM, especially in the fashion apparel, consumer electronics, and toy sectors. Retail demand is highly volatile and uncertain, consumers’ valuations change rapidly over time, and with short selling seasons and long production and distribution lead times, supply is quite inflexible. On the technology front, the introduction of bar codes and point-of-sale (POS) technology has resulted in a high degree of automation of sales transactions for most major retailers.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy sector has been a recent adopter of RM methods as well, principally in the area of managing the sale of pipeline capacity for gas transportation. Again, energy demands are volatile and uncertain, and the technology for generating and transmitting electricity and gas can be inflexible. Also, thanks to deregulation in the industry, there has been a lot of experimentation and innovation in the pricing practices of energy, gas, and transmission\n",
    "markets.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Conceptual Framework for RM\n",
    "RM generally follows four steps:<br><br>\n",
    "1. Data collection: collect and store relevant historical data such as prices, demand and causal factors.<br>\n",
    "2. Estimation and forecasting: estimate the demand, price elasticity, cancellation rate, and so on.<br>\n",
    "3. Optimization: find optimal control policies such as product allocations, prices, discounts and so on.<br>\n",
    "4. Control: control inventory.<br><br>\n",
    "In reality, the RM process involves cycling through the steps above in repeated intervals.<br><br>\n",
    "Example: a quantity-based RM system<br>\n",

If we protect too many rooms, i.e., $D<Q$, then we end up earning nothing on $Q-D$ rooms. So the overage penalty $C$ is $r_L$ per unsold room. If we protect too few rooms, i.e., $D<Q$, then we forgo $r_H-r_L$ in potential revenue on each of the $D-Q$ rooms that could have been sold at the higher fare so the underage penalty $B$ is $r_H-r_L$.
